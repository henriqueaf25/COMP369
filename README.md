# Graph Theory Algorithms :
### Every single program has a "./namesourcefile -h" command that shows a guide to execute
## Bellman-Ford Algorithm
The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph even with a negative weight.

## Prim's Algorithm
Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.
## Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. Differente from Bellman-Ford algorithm, Dijkstra's don't accept negative weighted edges but in the other hand it's more efficient. 
## Kruskal's Algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph. If the graph is connected, it finds a minimum spanning tree.
